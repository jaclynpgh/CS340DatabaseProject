# Mooncake High School Class Management Database
### Overview
Mooncake High School has 90 classrooms with a student body of roughly 2000 students and a faculty of 90 teachers every year. There are approximately 240 classes available throughout the school year. Our database-driven website will record which/how many students are in each class, as well as which classroom is associated with each class. This can be used to make sure each teacher has a roughly equal number of students and that each classroom isnâ€™t double-booked.
